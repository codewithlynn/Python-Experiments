# Python-Experiments

This repository contains the intial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

## **Plan**

Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.
